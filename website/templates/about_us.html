        Our Story<br>
            We started as a group of students who met at a data science bootcamp in March 2023. We were assigned as a team for a project, but completed that project as a group of friends.

        Our Vision<br>
            Our collective vision is to become well-versed and fluent in a variety of data services. We hope to harness the power of data to influence data-driven decisions that improve the quality of life and the world at large, perhaps even catalyzing world peace.
